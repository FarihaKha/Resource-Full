  <h1>Essential Items</h1>
  <p>One of the resources that are very important for all BIPOC communities are essential items such as food and shelter. Minorities experience starvation and homelessness at a much higher rate compared to white New Yorkers, which is why we are highlighting a few resources located in New York that can help. Please donate to the organizations you want to support!</p>
