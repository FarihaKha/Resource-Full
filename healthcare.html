<u><h3>What is Healthcare? </h3></u>

It is delivered by health professionals and allied health fields. Healthcare is an important essiential quality for everyone's lives because everyone needs it to become healthy ands strive. Unfortunately, colored people do not recieve the better of it because they either do not have enough money to pay the bills or other issues that prevent them from being able to have health care. Especially at a time like this with the COVID-19 crisis, healthcare is a necessity because some people do not have access to testing and vaccines.</h4>
